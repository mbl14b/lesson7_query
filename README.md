### Project Description:
(In this assignment, we explored JQuery and Document Object Model (DOM) traversal statements. JQuery was utilized so that we could respond to user requests, as we built an application that displayed elements containing a recipe's ingredients and instructions. We accessed elements using JQuery syntax and used the built-in Query syntax.)

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (JQuery is a commonly used library that allows developers to implement common tasks with minimal code as it creates a shortcut from the complicated parts of writing in JavaScript. It enables you to automatically include alternate code when necessary, in a cross-browser library, in order to support a variety of different browsers.It alleviates the monotonous work of coding JavaScript.)
2. (The jQuery syntax is tailor-made for selecting HTML elements and performing some action on the elements.)
3. (jQuery traversing, which means "moving through", is used to "find" HTML elements based on their relation to other elements. You start with one selection and move through that selection until you reach the elements you desire.)
